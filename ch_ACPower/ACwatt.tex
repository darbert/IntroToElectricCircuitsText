\begin{itemize}
\item Power for AC circuits looks a little different than for DC
\item $p(t) = v(t)*i(t)$ %, but we usually want some sort of average power
\item Plot voltage, current, and power for a resistive load
\item Do the same for a capacitive, inductive load
\item Again for resistive + capacitive
\item Find average power through integration
\end{itemize}
