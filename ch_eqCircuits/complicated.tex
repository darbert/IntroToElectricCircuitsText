\begin{itemize}
\item Recognizing elements in series or parallel is often the most difficult part of simplifying circuits
\item Reorganizing the circuits can help in this process
\item The process looks something like this:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Determine the number of nodes and label each
  \item Draw each of the nodes in a line
  \item Identify connections between the nodes
  \item Draw each of those connections, making connections between adjacent nodes close to the center line, and connection between more distant nodes further from the center line
  \item Elements in series and parallel are now easier to identify
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
