This chapter introduces the concept of an equivalent circuit.  Two equivalent circuits share common values of voltage/current at a point of interest, usually the source.  In this chapter, we will simplify complex resistive circuits down to the simplest version (such as those analyzed in Section \ref{sec:FL_simpleCircuit}).  Once simplified, we will expand them again through methods known as voltage division and current division to find the current through each element and the voltage at each node.
