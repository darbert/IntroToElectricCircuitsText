The things in this section are parts of mathematics that are critical to success in an introductory Circuits course, but that we assume you already know.  In that vein, this section will not be an in-depth coverage of the topic of Algebra, but rather an overview of the specific topics that you will need.
\subsection*{Isolating Variables}
\subsection*{Simple Systems of Equations}
\subsection*{Trigonometry}
\subsection*{Sine and Cosine Curves}
