\begin{itemize}
\item Inductors are energy storage devices that create a magnetic field
\item Typically composed of a coil of wire surrounding a ferromagnetic core
\item Magnetic fields resist change, and the change in the magnetic field per change in time results in a voltage difference (Faraday's law): $\Delta V = -\frac{d \Phi}{d t}$
\item The magnetic field generated is proportional to the current through the inductor: $\Phi = Li$
\item $L$ is the inducatance of the inductor, and is measured in Henrys (H)
\item Through the same methods as capacitors, it is possible to reduce $\Delta V = -\frac{d \Phi}{d t}$ to $\Delta V = i Z_L$, where $Z_L=j\omega L$
\item The energy stored in the inductor is $E_L=\frac{1}{2}Li^2$
