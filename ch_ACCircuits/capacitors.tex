\begin{itemize}
\item Capacitors are energy storage devices that store up electric charge
\item Most simply two plates in parallel with a gap filled with some non-conducting material
\item Amount of charge stored is proportional to voltage: $q=CV$
\item $C$ is the {\bf capacitance} of the capacitor, and is measured in Farads (F)
\item Current is change in charge per change in time: $i = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$
\item Can be analyzed through Calculus ($i = \frac{d q}{d t}$)
\item Using Euler's Formula and Calculus, it is possible to reduce $q=CV$ to $\Delta V=iZ_C$, where $Z_C=\frac{1}{j\omega C}$
\item Again using Calculus, it is possible to find that $E_C=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$
\item Full mathematical details in Appendix (not yet!)
