\begin{itemize}
\item Callback to Euler's Formula (back to Ch. 1)
\item $\cos{\omega t + \phi} = \Re \left\{ e^{j\omega t}e^{j\phi} \right\}$
\item Give an amplitude associated with the circuit:
  $\Re \left\{ A e^{j\omega t}e^{j\phi} \right\}$
\item Hide $e^{j\omega t}$, since we typically only deal with one frequency at a time:
  $\Re \left\{ A e^{j\phi} \right\}$
\item Hide the $\Re$, since we know we want the real part:
  $Ae^{j\phi}$
\item Replace $e^{j\phi}$ with the simpler $\angle\phi$:
  $A\angle\phi$
\item Now you have phasor notation
\end{itemize}
